ng-container is an html grouping element which you can use under the hood in Angular without ever seeing it in your final html output.

Hence if I add this to my template:

<div>
  <ng-container class="yada">
    <ng-container class="yada">
      <ng-container class="yada">
      i am inside an container
      </ng-container>
    </ng-container>
  </ng-container>
</div>

When rendered it looks like this:
<div _ngcontent-kgk-c1="">
	<!---->
	<!---->
	<!---->
	" i am inside an container "
</div>

This serves 2 main purposes:
- First it avoids unnecessary divs. If you need an *ngIf you may not necessarily want another div with it.
- Second, it allows us to workround the restriction that we cannot have 2 structural directives on the same element.
	- In practical terms (for most people) this only ever comes down to having an *ngIf and an *ngFor on the same element
