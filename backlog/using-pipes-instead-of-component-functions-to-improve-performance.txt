todo

use the example of making changes to the page - it re-calls these component function each time

pipes take into account that the input hasn't changed - hence are much more efficient

also mention the @memo decorator that can cache the inputs into a pure function to reduce the processing needed (good if not a lot of inputs, lots of duplication)
