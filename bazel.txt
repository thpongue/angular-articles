- Many of us have heard of Bazel through it's use with Angular, but it actually supports a number of Languages
- It's been used internally at Google for a long time - so it's very well tested
- It is intelligent enough to only recompile the files that have been changed
- Likewise with tests
- It is particularly useful on large codebases
- It can be integrated easily with Docker where necessary
- It has an IntelliJ plugin
- The first build with Bazel is extra slow - for example, if you test in chrome it will download a particular chrome version to ensure all tests are the same across devices
- There are CLI schematics to make this all easier
- Install as follows (note: add schematic, global install, new schematic):
	- ng add @angular/bazel
	- npm install -g @angular/bazel
- When i tried it on my Mac it failed - probably something to do with xcode that I'm not interested in debugging or getting to the bottom of
	- just be aware that installation may not be as simple as above
