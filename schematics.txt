Schematics are a template-based system for modifying your CLI project. Usually a set of related schematics will be bundled up into an npm package. This is known as a collection.

For example, the cypress schematic has functionality for removing the default e2e tool, protractor, as well as more standardised methods for running the cypress tests.

The great thing about this is that everyone doesn't have to roll their own solutions. If I've used Cypress for 1 Angular project then the tooling should be the same for the next.

There are 3 types of schematic:
1. add eg ng add @angular/pwa - turns your app into a PWA by adding things like a service worker, manifest etc
2. generate ng generate @angular/material:table - adds a material table to your project
3. update - this adds a little more functionality to an npm install, as it also has the ability to update your project as well as its package dependencies

All of the existing code generation tooling in the CLI uses schematics under the hood.
For example, ng generate component uses this: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/component/index.ts
