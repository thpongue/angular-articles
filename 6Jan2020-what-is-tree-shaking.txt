Tree shaking is a step in a build process that removes unused code from a code base.

It is a term commonly heard in the Angular community but tree shaking isn't unique to Angular. It is an important part of the Angular compilation process though.

Angular is a large codebase with a great deal of functionaluty. No Angular app is realistically going to need everything Angular offers so it is useful to prune away anything that isn't needed.

When looking into tree-shaking it is tempting to create a sample CLI application and run it locally in order to investigate. This won't tell you much as tree shaking is only part of the prod build process.

Instead your best bet is to do a production build but for readibility generate the code without minifying it:
ng build --prod --optimization=false

Dynamic vs static imports
--------------------------------------------------------------

One of the requirements for tree shaking is that imports cannot be dynamic eg
if (blah) {
	import thing A
} else {
	import thing B
}

The typescript convention of having static imports outside of any code logic means that typescript has one important prerequisite for tree shaking.


Unused imports and unused functions removed
--------------------------------------------------------------

The first one seems like common sense - even my IDE knows which imports aren't used. These are stripped out.

The second part is a bit more clever. These means that if I import a class with 2 methods and I use 1 of them then the other 1 gets stripped out.
